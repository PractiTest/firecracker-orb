  Regular run of firecracker that will,
  run ruby tests and upload the results to Practitest via Firecracker.

  !!!important!!!
  In case you don't run your circleci as machine user or don't have java on the image you use, you will need to add those lines as a step:
  ~~~
  - setup_remote_docker:
              version: 19.03.13
  ~~~
  **before** you run your tests (in case they fail).
usage:
  version: 2.1
  orbs:
    firecracker: practitest/firecracker@0.0.5
  jobs:
    build:
      docker:
        - image: circleci/ruby:2.5.5-node
      # in case you don't run as machine you will need to add a remote docker for the firecracker orb.
      # !!! that will need to run before your tests in case they fail !!!
      steps:
        - setup_remote_docker:
            version: 19.03.13
        # run tests!
        - run_test:
            command: run test
        # collect reports
        - store_test_results:
            # need to be set to test_folder parameter of firecracker
            path: test_results

        # the actual run of firecracker
        - firecracker/fire:
