  Regular run of firecracker that will,
  run ruby tests and upload the results to Practitest via Firecracker.

  !!!important!!!

  In case you don't run your circleci as machine user you will need to add these lines as a step:

  - setup_remote_docker:
              version: 19.03.13

  before you run your tests (in case they fail).

  In case you use EU environment you will need to change api_uri into https://eu1-prod.practitest.app/
usage:
  version: 2.1
  orbs:
    firecracker: practitest/firecracker@1.0.0
  jobs:
    build:
      docker:
        - image: circleci/ruby:2.5.5-node
      # in case you don't run as machine you will need to add a remote docker for the firecracker orb.
      # !!! that will need to run before your tests in case they fail!!!
      steps:
        - setup_remote_docker:
            version: 19.03.13
        # run tests!
        - run_test:
            command: run test
        # collect reports
        - store_test_results:
            # need to be set to test_folder parameter of firecracker
            path: test_results

        # the actual run of firecracker
        - firecracker/fire:
            firecracker_version: v2.0.3
